# Initialize Cargo Project Structure

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/apithing/ideas/start.md

## Goal
Set up the basic Rust crate structure with proper Cargo.toml configuration.

## Tasks
- Run `cargo init --lib` to create the library crate
- Configure Cargo.toml with proper metadata:
  - Name: `apithing` 
  - Version: `0.1.0`
  - Edition: `2021`
  - Description: "A standardized API approach based on content and prop traits"
  - License: `MIT OR Apache-2.0`
  - Repository URL
- Create .gitignore with Rust-specific ignores
- Remove default lib.rs content, ready for our implementation

## Success Criteria
- `cargo check` runs without errors
- Project structure follows Rust conventions
- Cargo.toml has all required metadata

## Architecture Notes
This establishes the foundation for a trait-based API framework that will support multiple API families with shared contexts.
