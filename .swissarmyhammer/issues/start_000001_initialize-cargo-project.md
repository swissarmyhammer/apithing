# Initialize Cargo Project Structure

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/apithing/ideas/start.md

## Goal
Set up the basic Rust crate structure with proper Cargo.toml configuration.

## Tasks
- Run `cargo init --lib` to create the library crate
- Configure Cargo.toml with proper metadata:
  - Name: `apithing` 
  - Version: `0.1.0`
  - Edition: `2021`
  - Description: "A standardized API approach based on content and prop traits"
  - License: `MIT OR Apache-2.0`
  - Repository URL
- Create .gitignore with Rust-specific ignores
- Remove default lib.rs content, ready for our implementation

## Success Criteria
- `cargo check` runs without errors
- Project structure follows Rust conventions
- Cargo.toml has all required metadata

## Architecture Notes
This establishes the foundation for a trait-based API framework that will support multiple API families with shared contexts.

## Proposed Solution

Initialize the Cargo project structure following standard Rust conventions:

1. **Use `cargo init --lib`** - Creates the standard library crate structure
2. **Configure comprehensive Cargo.toml metadata** - Include all recommended fields for a public crate
3. **Establish proper .gitignore** - Add Rust-specific ignores while preserving existing entries
4. **Prepare minimal lib.rs** - Remove default content and add documentation foundation
5. **Verify build system** - Ensure `cargo check` works without errors

## Implementation Notes

**Cargo.toml Configuration:**
- Updated edition to 2021 (from default 2024) as specified in requirements
- Added comprehensive metadata: description, license, repository, authors, categories, keywords
- Set license to dual MIT/Apache-2.0 following Rust ecosystem best practices
- Added repository URL pointing to the project location
- Included categories and keywords for discoverability

**Library Structure:**
- Replaced default `add` function with proper crate documentation
- Added `#![warn(missing_docs)]` and `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` lint attributes
- Prepared foundation with module-level documentation explaining the crate's purpose
- Left placeholder comment indicating where core traits will be implemented

**Build System Verification:**
- `cargo check` passes without errors or warnings
- `cargo fmt` applied to ensure consistent formatting
- Project ready for incremental development following TDD principles

**Git Integration:**
- Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive Rust-specific entries
- Added common IDE and OS file patterns
- Preserved existing SwissArmyHammer-specific ignores

The project now has a solid foundation ready for trait-based API framework implementation as described in the reference material.

## Code Review Resolution - 2025-08-29

Successfully addressed all issues identified in the code review:

### Issues Resolved
1. **Duplicate .gitignore entry**: Removed duplicate `/target` entry
2. **README.md reference**: Removed `readme = "README.md"` line from Cargo.toml since no README exists
3. **Placeholder tests**: Removed trivial tests that provided no real validation

### Verification
- ✅ `cargo check` passes without errors
- ✅ `cargo clippy` passes without warnings  
- ✅ `cargo test` passes (0 tests, which is correct after removing placeholders)
- ✅ Project structure remains clean and follows Rust conventions

### Code Quality
All identified code quality issues have been resolved. The project now has:
- Clean .gitignore without duplicates
- Valid Cargo.toml configuration without non-existent file references
- Minimal lib.rs foundation without meaningless tests

The codebase is now ready for core trait implementation in subsequent issues.
