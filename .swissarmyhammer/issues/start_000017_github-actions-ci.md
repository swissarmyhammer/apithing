# GitHub Actions CI/CD

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/apithing/ideas/start.md

## Goal
Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Tasks
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
  - Rust toolchain setup (stable, beta, nightly)
  - Multiple OS support (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
  - `cargo build` for compilation verification
  - `cargo test` for all tests (unit + integration)
  - `cargo clippy` for linting
  - `cargo fmt --check` for formatting
  - `cargo doc` for documentation generation
- Create `.github/workflows/security.yml`:
  - `cargo audit` for security vulnerabilities
  - Dependency scanning
- Add CI status badges preparation
- Configure caching for faster builds
- Set up test coverage reporting (optional)

## Success Criteria
- CI pipeline passes for all supported platforms
- All quality checks (build, test, lint, format, docs) pass
- Security scanning completes without issues
- Build times are reasonable with caching
- Pipeline provides clear feedback on failures

## CI Configuration
```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - name: Run tests
        run: cargo test --verbose
      # Additional steps...
```

CI should ensure code quality and compatibility across different environments.
